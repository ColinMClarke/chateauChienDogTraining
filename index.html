            <h2>Good Doggie!</h2>
            <p>Chateau Chien welcomes all of our furry friends to bring your person and train them to keep you happy. Whether you are just a pup getting to know your new family, a young dog learning your first tricks, or a more mature dog who needs an etiquette refresher, we have a class for you.</p>
            <!-- Seperate paragraphs with each getting their own set of p tags. -->
            <p>Our trainers offer group classes where you can make some new friends and watch them train their people while you train yours. We also have private sessions if you are a bit shy or need something special.</p>
