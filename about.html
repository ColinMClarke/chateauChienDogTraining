      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Luca Rossi</h2>
      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">Founder and President / 1997-2024</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent">Luca Rossi, the founder and heart of Chateau Chien, possesses an unwavering passion for all things canine. His journey began decades ago when he rescued a timid stray dog named Éclair from the bustling streets of Paris. Éclair’s transformation from a fearful pup to a confident, well-behaved companion ignited Luca’s purpose.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  With a background in behavioral psychology and a heart full of empathy, Luca established Chateau Chien in a charming converted farmhouse. His philosophy? Every dog deserves a chance to thrive. Over the years, he has honed his skills, blending positive reinforcement techniques with a touch of magic—because, as he often quips, “Training dogs is like conducting a symphony; it requires finesse, patience, and a dash of whimsy.”
	  <br>
	  <br>  
	  Luca’s commitment extends beyond training sessions. He hosts monthly “Bark and Brie” gatherings, where clients and their furry friends share stories over artisanal cheese and freshly baked baguettes. His office walls bear witness to countless graduation photos, each dog proudly donning a cap and diploma.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  As the sun sets over the Chateau’s sprawling gardens, Luca can be found sipping chamomile tea, reflecting on the joy he’s brought to countless tails that now wag with confidence. His legacy? A harmonious blend of compassion, expertise, and a touch of Parisian flair—all woven into the fabric of Chateau Chien. </p>

      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle"> Ngoc Nguyen</h2>
      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">Head Trainer / 2007-2024</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> Born into a family of farmers, she spent her childhood chasing dragonflies and listening to the whispers of the wind. But it was the village dogs—their eyes filled with ancient wisdom—that captured her heart.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Ngoc’s journey began when she stumbled upon an injured dog named Luna near the village temple. Luna’s coat was as black as the night sky, and her spirit, wounded but resilient, mirrored the struggles of the land. Ngoc nursed Luna back to health, and in those quiet moments, she realized that her true calling lay beyond the farm land.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Ngoc began studying Animal Psychology at Can Tho University where she learned how to harness her passion for betteing the lives of animals. She later finished her degree stateside at University of Washington. 
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Ngoc met Luca at an animal behavior conference in Los Angelos. Luca was impressed with Ngoc's fusion of Eastern and Western dog training philosphies and asked her to join Chateau Chien. She quickly established herself as a trusted leader and was promoted to Head Trainer in 2007. Ngoc now designs a variety of course offerings for Chateau Chien.</p>
